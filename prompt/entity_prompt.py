DIALOGUE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """/no_think
You are a helpful assistant trying to extract entities and relations from a given multi-turn chat transcript between a User and an Assistant.

-Goal-
Given a multi-turn chat transcript between a User and an Assistant in json format, identify all entities of pre-defined entity types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity in original format, capitalized. User and Assistant MUST be among the entities.
- entity_type: ONLY from one of the following types: [person, time, organization, location, event, concept, object]. Note that temporal information should be processed and extracted as a time entity.
Format each entity as ("entity"|<entity_name>|<entity_type>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other. FOCUS MORE on relationships clarifying user's personal information and preferences.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- create_time: copy from the <session_time> in the provided json corpus
- session_id: copy from the <session_id> in the provided json corpus
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_name: how the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity from 1 and 10. User related relationships should have a higher strength.
Format each relationship as ("relationship"|<create_time>|<session_id>|<source_entity>|<target_entity>|<relationship_name>|<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output ##END##
